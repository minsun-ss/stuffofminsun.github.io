(Naturally) continued to forget about my github. Renamed my git username and then forgot I should've renamed my github 
pages repo as well.

Experimenting with educative since I saw an ad during the AOC and went with C++ because I have a raspberry pi 4 and
the work involved in setting up python on an aarch64 architecture was so annoying and most of the C++ tools were already
in place that I just went with C++ (with that said, I got most of python set up anyway). While I like the fact that 
educative skips over the video lecture entirely (never been a strong fan of that in MOOCs), so far think the 
educative exercises could be beefed up. Admittedly I'm not that far in the C++ module because I've been pretty lazy 
even though the early going is pretty straightforward since operators are pretty much all the same regardless of 
language. I did a [dash dashboard](https://siads591-sscc.herokuapp.com/) with it too. 

Should've mentioned that I did a milestone project involving fish back in August 2020. You can see it [here](https://github.com/minsun-ss/argo_ocean_data_analysis).

My ML milestone will involve uh... *checks notes* ... small cap stocks, I think. My partner thinks it's high time
I enter the quant world, which I find mostly dubious. Is it really quantlike to think that like 99% of problems can
be solved with a linear regression?
